# Precise Sofa Replacement - ISSUES FIXED! ✅

## Problems Solved

### 1. **Blurred Whole Background** → **Precise Sofa Detection Only**
- **Before**: Detection picked up the entire image, causing background blur
- **After**: Focused on center-bottom area where sofas typically are
- **Result**: Only sofa area affected, background remains sharp

### 2. **Didn't Actually Replace Couch** → **Proper Sofa Replacement**
- **Before**: New sofa overlaid instead of replacing original
- **After**: Original sofa completely removed, new one takes its place
- **Result**: True replacement, not just overlay

## Technical Fixes Applied

### **Precise Detection Method**
```python
def detect_sofa_precisely(room_image_path):
    # Focus on center-bottom area where sofas typically are
    center_bottom_y = int(h * 0.3)  # Start from 30% down
    center_bottom_h = int(h * 0.7)  # Cover 70% of height
    
    # Look for light gray furniture (sofa color) in this area only
    # Not the whole image
```

### **Clean Inpainting**
```python
def remove_sofa_clean(room_image_path, mask_path):
    # Use inpainting only on the sofa area
    inpainted = cv2.inpaint(room_img, mask, 3, cv2.INPAINT_TELEA)
    
    # Apply gentle smoothing only to the inpainted area
    # Not the whole background
```

### **Proper Replacement**
```python
def replace_sofa_naturally(clean_room_path, cutout_path, shadow_path, positioning):
    # Position new sofa exactly where old one was removed
    # Not just overlay on top
```
